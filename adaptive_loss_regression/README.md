# Adaptive Loss Regression Model

This project utilizes the adaptive loss function introduced in the paper [A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Barron_A_General_and_Adaptive_Robust_Loss_Function_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf),  Jonathan T. Barron CVPR, 2019.
The majority of the codes (or the installation method of the package) can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/robust_loss).

My implementation method is based on PyTorch, and this is my first simple project to construct model in pytorch for self-defined regression tasks. The dataset and features are removed, but the general procedure of training by including batch and epoch are useful.
